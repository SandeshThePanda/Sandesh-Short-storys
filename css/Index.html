      <center><h2>What is Global warming?</h2>
        <center><p>Global warming refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s,<br> human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels <i>(like coal, oil and gas),</i> which produces heat-trapping gases which makes the temperatur go higher and higher.</p></center>
        <center><h4>9 facts about global warming.</h4></center>
        
         <ul> 
          <li>Thereâ€™s more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere than at any time in human history</li>
      <li>we on the path to exceeding 1.5C of warming</li>
         <li> remaining carbon budget is tiny</li>
         <li>Extreme heat events have become more frequent and severe</LI>
        <li>Humans have already caused 1.07C of warming</li>  
        <li>Sea levels are rising faster today than ever before</li>  
        <li>Arctic sea ice is rapidly diminishing</li>
        <li>Two-thirds of extreme weather events in the last 20 years were influenced by human</li>
        <li>And last but not least, Average wildlife populations have dropped by 60 per cent in just over 40 years</li>
         </ul>
        <h4>What can <bold>you</bold> do to reduce it?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Save energy at home<i>( so by doing this the whole world uses less power thus commiting less toxic gases to the natural enviroment)</i></li>
         
          <li>Walk or use public transport <I>(By doing this the  monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC)</I></li>
          
          <li>Eat more vegetables<i>(Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.)</i></li>
           
        </ul>
