    <h2>Short story</h2>
    <h4>Story of Ozymandias</h4>
    <p>I met a traveller form an antique land who said</p>
    <p>"two vast an dtrunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.</p>
    <p>near them on the sand, half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculpter well those passions read which yet survice.</p>
  <p>Stamped on these lifeless things</p>
  <p> THe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.</p>
  <p>And on the pedestal these words appear</p>
<p>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: look on my works, ye mighty and dispair!</p>
<p>Nothing but remains</p>
<p>Round the decay on the colossal wreck</p>
<p> BOundless and bear</p>
<p>Stamped on these lifeless things</p>
